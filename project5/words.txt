A
home
page
is
generally
the
main
page
a
visitor
navigating
to
a
website
from
a
web
search
engine
will
see,
and
it
may
also
serve
as
a
landing
page
to
attract
visitors.
The
home
page
is
used
to
facilitate
navigation
to
other
pages
on
the
site
by
providing
links
to
prioritized
and
recent
articles
and
pages,
and
possibly
a
search
box.
For
example,
a
news
website
may
present
headlines
and
first
paragraphs
of
top
stories,
with
links
to
full
articles,
in
a
dynamic
web
page
that
reflects
the
popularity
and
recentness
of
stories.
Meanwhile,
other
websites
use
the
homepage
to
attract
users
to
create
an
account.
Once
they
are
logged
in,
the
homepage
may
be
redirected
to
their
profile
page.
This
may
in
turn
be
referred
to
as
the
"personal
home
page".
